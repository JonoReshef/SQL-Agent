## Development instructions

- Do not stop until an error occurs which you cannot resolve after extensively troubleshooting, a clarifying question is needed, or the task is complete.
- Always think through the user's query and understand their intent before taking action.
- When you need to ask a clarifying question, do so directly and wait for a response.
- Devise a clear plan of action to answer the question or complete the task.
- Use context7 to inform your approach and ensure your responses are relevant and accurate.
- Search the internet for relevant documentation, examples, and best practices as needed.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code following best practices for the specific programming
- Never use emojis
- Do not create markdown files explaining what was complete unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Build an application following an eager test driven development (TDD) approach, writing tests before implementing features and then continuously running the tests to ensure functionality, as well as expanding test coverage throughout the development process and re-evaluating existing tests for relevance and accuracy.
- Reference `README.md` for project overview and setup instructions. Update it as necessary to reflect changes made during development.
- Always explain your answers as if you are talking to a senior software engineer
- When a question is asked or some options could be considered, come up with 3 options which include: a simple solution which can be implemented easily and quickly, a solution which meets requirements and follows good practice and a solution which is suitable for an enterprise level solution
